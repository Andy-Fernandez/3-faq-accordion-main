## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Hide/Show the answer to a question when the question is clicked
- Navigate the questions and hide/show answers using keyboard navigation alone
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- JavaScript (for interaction, minimal DOM manipulation)

### What I learned

In this project, I learned how to:

- Implement accessible interactive elements with JavaScript, such as toggling the visibility of FAQ answers.
- Enhance user experience by incorporating keyboard navigation and responsive design.
- Use HTML ARIA attributes to improve accessibility and provide meaningful states for interactive elements.

### Continued development

In the future, I plan to:

- Refine the JavaScript code to handle multiple open/close interactions more efficiently.
- Improve accessibility features further by adding ARIA roles and states.
- Optimize the CSS for better performance and adaptability to different screen sizes.
